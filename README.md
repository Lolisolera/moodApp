# 🎧 MoodApp — Visualize Your Mood Through Music and Images

**MoodApp** is an interactive full-stack application that transforms your emotions into visuals and sound.  
Simply type how you’re feeling, and the app generates:

- 🎵 A **mood-matching playlist or song** (via the free **Deezer API**)
- 🖼️ A **related background image** (via the free **Pexels API**)

It’s an artistic fusion of **music, mood, and visual design** — built using modern web technologies.

- Instantly see a matching background image
- Listen to a 30-second track preview directly in the browser
